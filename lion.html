                <h3>LION<h3>
                 <p>The Lion is a species in the family felidea and a member of the guns panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominant mane. With a typiacal head-to-body length of 184-208 cm they are larger than females at 160-184 cm. It is a social species, forming groups called prids. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
                 <p>Typically the lion inhabits grassland and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and N orth America, but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-saharan africa and one ctitally endangered population in western india. It has bee listed as vulnerable on th ICUN RED LIST since 1996 because population in african countries have declined by about 43% since the early the 1990s. Lion populatins are untenable outside designated protected areas. although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
