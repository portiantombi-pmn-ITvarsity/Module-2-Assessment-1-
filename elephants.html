              <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
              <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidea and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the african elephant(Loxodonta africana) and the asian elephant(Elephas maximums). Elphants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weight 7,000 kg (15,000lb).</p>
            <p>All elephants gave several distintive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their bddy temperature. Their  pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have similar ears and convex or level backs.</p>
              
              <p>Elephants are herbivores and can be found in different habitats including savannhats, forests, deserts and mashes. they prefer to stay near water.</p>
              <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
              <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
